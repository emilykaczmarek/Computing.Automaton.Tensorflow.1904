# My favorite way to install custom-compiled software is in my $HOME directory. That way you don't have to use sudo for anything, and it's # very nicely separated from the rest of your system. For example:
#
# mkdir ~/stage
# ./configure --prefix=/home/username/stage && make && make install
# And if you want to, you can then add /home/username/stage/bin to your $PATH. 
#
#

$ mkdir ~/anaconda
